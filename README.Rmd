The goal of contactdata is to provide access to social contact data for 152
countries. This data comes from

> Kiesha Prem, Alex R. Cook, Mark Jit, *Projecting social contact matrices in 
152 countries using contact surveys and demographic data*, PLoS Comp. Biol.
(2017), https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005697.

(please cite it in your publications, alongside this package).

contactdata offers an easier access to this data, makes it readily compatible
with [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org/) packages, such as 
[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), via the `contact_countries()` 
function, and provides an easy way to harmonise country nomenclature by using
the [countrycode](https://cran.r-project.org/package=countrycode) package as
authoritative name source.

## Installation

You can install the development version of contactdata from GitHub with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Bisaloo/contactdata")
```

## Example

The most basic function allows you to get matrix data for a specific country:

```{r example}
library(contactdata)
contact_matrix("France")
```

You can also get several countries at once with the `contact_df_countries()`
function, as detailed in the 
[vignette](https://bisaloo.github.io/contactdata/articles/visualise.html).
