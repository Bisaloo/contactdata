The goal of contactdata is to provide access to social contact data for 152
countries. This data comes from

> Kiesha Prem, Alex R. Cook, Mark Jit, *Projecting social contact matrices in 
152 countries using contact surveys and demographic data*, PLoS Comp. Biol.
(2017), https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005697.

and

> Kiesha Prem, Kevin van Zandvoort, Petra Klepac, Rosalind M. Eggo, Nicholas G.
Davies, CMMID COVID-19 Working Group, Alex R. Cook, Mark Jit, *Projecting
contact matrices in 177 geographical regions: An update and comparison with
empirical data for the COVID-19 era*, PLoS Comp. Biol. (2021),
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009098.

(please cite them in your publications, alongside this package).

contactdata offers an easier access to this data, makes it readily compatible
with [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages, such as 
[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), via the `contact_countries()` 
function, and provides an easy way to harmonise country nomenclature by using
the [countrycode](https://cran.r-project.org/package=countrycode) package as
authoritative name source.

## Installation

You can install this package from CRAN:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("contactdata")
```

or the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/bisaloo), via my 
[r-universe](https://bisaloo.r-universe.dev/):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("contactdata", repos = "https://bisaloo.r-universe.dev")
```

## Example

The most basic function allows you to get matrix data for a specific country:

```{r example}
library(contactdata)
contact_matrix("France")
```

You can also get several countries at once with the `contact_df_countries()`
function, as detailed in the 
[vignette](https://bisaloo.github.io/contactdata/articles/visualise.html).

Because it is very likely that users of this package will also need data about
the population in each age group, it is also bundled in this package for
convenience. Please see `?age_df_countries` for more information.
